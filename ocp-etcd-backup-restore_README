#OCP ETCD BACKUP RESTORE:

##ETCD:
Etcd is the persistent data store for Kubernetes. It is a distributed key-value store that records the state of all resources in a Kubernetes cluster.
Etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store which is simple, fast and secure. 
It acts like a backend service discovery and database, runs on different servers in Kubernetes clusters at the 
same time to monitor changes in clusters and to store state/configuration data that should to be accessed by a Kubernetes master or clusters.

##Backups and Disaster Recovery of OCP cluster:
we must back up etcd data before shutting down a cluster; etcd is the key-value store for OpenShift Container Platform, which persists the state of all resource objects. An etcd backup plays a crucial role in disaster recovery

You might run into several situations where OpenShift Container Platform does not work as expected, such as:

You have a cluster that is not functional after the restart because of unexpected conditions, such as node failure, or network connectivity issues.
You have deleted something critical in the cluster by mistake.
You have lost the majority of your control plane hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss.
You can always recover from a disaster situation by restoring your cluster to its previous state using the saved etcd snapshots.

*IMPORTANT
Disaster recovery/Restore requires you to have at least one healthy control plane host (also known as the master host).
User should run this plugin on bastion node if user wants to perform restore.[Bastion host is the host which is created using same network as the cluter and can ping the nodes of cluster.]
More information around bastion node - https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/networking/accessing-hosts.html

**Note:
User has to only create bastion node which should be accessed using ssh. This plugin will itself create ssh connectivity from bastion to cluster nodes.

If user has only lost some crucial cluster information then user can restore from the snapshot saved using this plugin
If user has lost nodes, then user has to run restore using this plugin. Create nodes and add to cluster and then run post restore option from this plugin.

###Pre-reqs:
1. krew - kubectl-plugin manager. Install from here
2. kubectl - kubernetes command-line tool. Install from here
3. Triliovault for kubernetes and TVK target.

## Installation, Upgrade, Removal of Plugins :

#### 1. With `krew`:

- Add TVK custom plugin index of krew:

  ```
  kubectl krew index add tvk-interop-plugin https://github.com/trilioData/tvk-interop-plugins.git
  ```

- Installation:

  ```
  kubectl krew install tvk-interop-plugin/ocp-etcd-backup-restore
  ```

- Upgrade:

  ```
  kubectl krew upgrade ocp-etcd-backup-restore
  ```

- Removal:

  ```
  kubectl krew uninstall ocp-etcd-backup-restore
  ```

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -backup
  -restore
  --target-name TARGET_NAME
                        The name of a single datastore on which etcd backup
                        needs to be shared
  --target-namespace TARGET_NAMESPACE
                        Namespace name where the target resides.
  --api-server-url API_SERVER_URL

  --ocp-cluster-user OCP_CLUSTER_USER
                        username used to login cluster.
  --ocp-cluster-pass OCP_CLUSTER_PASS
                        password to login cluster
  -p                    If users want to run only post restore tasks
  --log-location LOG_LOC
                        Log file name along with path where the logs should be
                        save default - /tmp/etcd-ocp-backup.log
